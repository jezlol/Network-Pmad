# 🔧 Supabase Database Connection Fix Guide

## 🎯 Problem Identified
Your application is showing "Database connection unavailable" because:
- ✅ Network connectivity is working
- ✅ Supabase services are operational  
- ❌ **Your IP address (101.109.17.21) is not whitelisted in Supabase**

## 🚀 Solution Steps

### Step 1: Add IP to Supabase Whitelist
1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `euxqozsuqjuvogootclk`
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **Database**
4. Scroll down to **Network Restrictions**
5. Add your IP address: `101.109.17.21`
6. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Update Database Connection String (Recommended)
Replace your current `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` with the **Direct Connection** string:

```env
# Replace this line in your .env file:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[YOUR_PASSWORD]@db.euxqozsuqjuvogootclk.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

### Step 3: Restart Docker Containers
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

## 🔍 Alternative: Disable IP Restrictions (Less Secure)
If you want to allow connections from any IP:
1. In Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database
2. Under **Network Restrictions**, select **Allow all IP addresses**
3. Click **Save**

⚠️ **Warning**: This is less secure and not recommended for production.

## 🧪 Test the Fix
After making changes, test the connection:
```bash
python test_connection_types.py
```

## 📝 Notes
- Your current IP: `101.109.17.21`
- Supabase project: `euxqozsuqjuvogootclk`
- Direct connection is more stable for Docker containers
- Changes may take 1-2 minutes to propagate

## 🆘 If Still Not Working
1. Double-check your database password
2. Verify the project ID in the connection string
3. Try connecting from a different network
4. Contact Supabase support if the issue persists
