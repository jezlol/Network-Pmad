# **1\. Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**

* Build a comprehensive network monitoring application capable of collecting data from diverse network devices (PCs, Routers, Switches).  
* Provide proactive, configurable alerting to notify users of network issues through multiple channels (Email, Discord, Line).  
* Empower users with automation capabilities, including running commands and basic device configuration via SSH.  
* Offer a clear, visual user interface that includes automated network mapping and asset inventory.  
* Ensure the application is secure, with encrypted communications and role-based access control.

## **Background Context**

Currently, managing a diverse network of devices requires multiple tools, and it's often difficult to get a single, unified view of network health. This project aims to solve that by creating a centralized monitoring application built on a modern tech stack (React, Python/Go, InfluxDB). The application will not only provide passive monitoring but will also enable proactive alerting and automated actions, allowing users to respond to issues like performance degradation or security events more effectively.
