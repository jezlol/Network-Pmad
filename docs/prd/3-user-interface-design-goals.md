# **3\. User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience should be clear, immediate, and actionable. The primary goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of network health at a glance, allowing users to quickly identify and diagnose problems. The interface will prioritize data density and clarity over purely aesthetic concerns, but will maintain a clean, modern, and professional look.

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Dashboard-centric:** The main entry point will be a dashboard that summarizes the most critical information.  
* **Drill-down:** Users can click on any element (like a device on the network map) to navigate to a more detailed view.  
* **Direct Configuration:** Alerting and device settings will be configured directly through forms and intuitive controls.

## **Core Screens and Views**

* **Main Dashboard:** Features the automated network map, a summary of online/offline devices, and a feed of recent critical alerts.  
* **Asset Inventory:** A searchable and sortable table view of all discovered network devices.  
* **Device Detail Page:** A dedicated view showing historical metrics, current status, and configuration options for a single device.  
* **Alerts Configuration Page:** A page where users can create, edit, and manage all alert rules.  
* **Alerts History:** A log of all past alert notifications.

## **Accessibility**

* **Standard:** WCAG AA. The application must be usable by people with disabilities, including full keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## **Branding**

* The application should have a modern, "tech-ops" feel. A dark-mode default is recommended to reduce eye strain during long monitoring sessions. Color should be used purposefully to convey status (e.g., green for 'OK', red for 'Error', yellow for 'Warning').

## **Target Device and Platforms**

* **Platforms:** Web Responsive. The primary experience is designed for desktop browsers, but the layout must adapt to be usable on tablets and mobile devices for on-the-go status checks.
