## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4: The dashboard is fully functional with network visualization, summary widgets, and device detail panels. The frontend uses React 18.2.0 with TypeScript, Zustand for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The app successfully handles mock data when backend is unavailable. All components are properly tested with Vitest and React Testing Library. [Source: Previous Story 1.4 completion notes]

### 1. **Uncaught (in promise) Error: Duplicate script ID 'fido2-page-script-registration'**
- **What it means:**  
  This error is not related to your app's code. It is likely caused by a browser extension (such as a password manager, security extension, or something related to FIDO2/WebAuthn authentication).
- **Action:**  
  You can safely ignore this for your app. If it bothers you, try disabling browser extensions one by one to find the culprit.

---

### 2. **Uncaught (in promise) Error: Frame with ID 217/218 is showing error page**
- **What it means:**  
  This is also likely from a browser extension or a browser-internal process, not your React app.
- **Action:**  
  Ignore for your app. If you want to eliminate it, try running your app in an incognito window with all extensions disabled.

---

### 3. **chunk-JSFS7AGR.js... Download the React DevTools for a better development experience**
- **What it means:**  
  This is an informational message from React, not an error. It suggests you install React DevTools for debugging.
- **Action:**  
  No action needed.

---

### 4. **LoginPage.tsx:50 Login failed: Error: Login failed**
- **What it means:**  
  This is a real error from your app. It means the login attempt failed, and the error was caught and logged in your `LoginPage.tsx` file.
- **Root cause:**  
  See the next error for the real reason.

---

### 5. **:8000/api/auth/login:1  Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED**
- **What it means:**  
  Your frontend tried to call the backend API at `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login`, but the backend server is not running or not reachable.
- **Action:**  
  - **Start your backend server** (FastAPI app) on port 8000.
    - If you are using `uvicorn`, run:  
      ```sh
      uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
      ```
    - Or use your project's preferred start command.
  - Make sure there are no firewall or network issues blocking port 8000.
  - Once the backend is running, try logging in again.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Error Message | Cause | Action |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| Duplicate script ID | Browser extension | Ignore/disable extensions |
| Frame with ID... | Browser extension | Ignore/disable extensions |
| React DevTools | Info from React | Ignore |
| Login failed | Backend not reachable | Start backend server |
| net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED | Backend not running | Start backend server |

---

## **Next Steps for You**

1. **Start your backend API server** on port 8000.
2. **Reload your frontend app** and try logging in again.
