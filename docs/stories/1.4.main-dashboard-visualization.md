# Story 1.4: Main Dashboard Visualization

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED & WORKING**

## Story
**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** a main dashboard that visualizes my network and shows key metrics at a glance,
**so that** I can quickly assess the overall health of my network.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ A "Dashboard" page is created as the main entry point.
2. ✅ The page displays the visual network map.
3. ✅ The dashboard includes summary widgets showing: Total Devices Online/Offline, Number of Active Alerts, and a graph of overall network traffic for the last hour.
4. ✅ Clicking on a device icon on the map opens a detailed side panel showing all collected metrics for that device.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3: The frontend has been successfully migrated to Vite for modern, fast builds. React Router is implemented for navigation between pages. Zustand is used for state management with device data fetching working properly. The Device model and API integration are fully functional. All tests are updated to use Vitest and React Testing Library with MemoryRouter. [Source: Previous Story 1.3 completion notes]

### Technology Stack Specifications
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: React 18.2.0, TypeScript 5.0.4, Tailwind CSS 3.3.3
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4.1
- **HTTP Client**: Axios 1.5.0
- **Testing**: Jest & Testing Library 29.7.0 (updated to Vitest in Story 1.3)

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
- **Device**: Represents a monitored device (id, ip_address, mac_address, hostname, etc.)
- **Metric**: A single data point from a device (device_id, metric_name, value, timestamp)
- **Alert Rule**: Defines conditions for an alert (id, name, metric_name, condition, threshold)

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
- **GET /api/devices**: Retrieves all discovered devices (already implemented)
- **GET /api/devices/{id}/metrics**: Fetches recent metrics for a specific device (needed for device detail panel)
- **GET /api/alerts/rules**: Get all alert rules (needed for active alerts widget)

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/7-unified-project-structure.md]
- Frontend code should be implemented in apps/frontend/
- Shared types are defined in packages/shared-types/
- Component structure follows apps/frontend/src/components/ pattern

### Frontend Architecture Context
[Source: apps/frontend/src/ structure analysis from Story 1.3]
- **Component Structure**: Components are in apps/frontend/src/components/
- **Service Layer**: API services are in apps/frontend/src/services/api.ts
- **State Management**: Zustand store is in apps/frontend/src/store/useDeviceStore.ts
- **Routing**: React Router is implemented with BrowserRouter, Routes, and Link components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is configured and being used throughout
- **Build System**: Vite is configured with TypeScript and path aliases

### File Locations and Naming Conventions
- **Pages**: apps/frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx
- **Components**: 
  - apps/frontend/src/components/NetworkMap.tsx
  - apps/frontend/src/components/SummaryWidgets.tsx
  - apps/frontend/src/components/DeviceDetailPanel.tsx
- **Services**: Extend apps/frontend/src/services/api.ts with new endpoints
- **Store**: Extend apps/frontend/src/store/useDeviceStore.ts or create new dashboard store
- **Tests**: 
  - apps/frontend/src/pages/__tests__/DashboardPage.test.tsx
  - apps/frontend/src/components/__tests__/NetworkMap.test.tsx
  - apps/frontend/src/components/__tests__/SummaryWidgets.test.tsx
  - apps/frontend/src/components/__tests__/DeviceDetailPanel.test.tsx

### Technical Implementation Notes
- **Routing**: Use existing React Router setup, make Dashboard the default route
- **API Integration**: Extend existing axios instance with new endpoints for metrics and alerts
- **State Management**: Extend existing Zustand store or create dashboard-specific store for map state
- **Network Map**: Use SVG or Canvas for network visualization, consider using a library like D3.js or React Flow
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure dashboard works on mobile devices with proper layout adjustments
- **TypeScript**: Use existing Device interface from shared-types package, extend with new interfaces for metrics and alerts
- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading for device details and optimize network map rendering

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Device interfaces are already in packages/shared-types, add new interfaces for metrics and alerts
- **Error Handling**: Use centralized error handling patterns established in api.ts
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for API URL are already configured

## Testing
Based on the Testing Strategy [Source: architecture/10-testing-strategy.md]:

**Unit Tests Required:**
- Vitest & React Testing Library tests for DashboardPage component
- Tests for NetworkMap component rendering and device interactions
- Tests for SummaryWidgets component with mock data
- Tests for DeviceDetailPanel component and side panel functionality
- Tests for API service functions for new endpoints

**Integration Tests:**
- Test complete flow from dashboard load to device detail display
- Test network map interactions and side panel opening/closing
- Test responsive design and mobile interactions
- Test error handling when API calls fail

**Test File Locations:**
- Frontend tests: test files in apps/frontend/src/ using Vitest & React Testing Library conventions
- Mock API responses for consistent testing
- Use MemoryRouter for routing tests
