# Story 1.1: Basic Project Setup and UI Shell

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** the basic application structure and a running UI shell,
**so that** I have a foundation to build all other features upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story - no previous context available.

### Architecture Overview
The system uses a **monorepo microservices architecture** with separate services for data collection (Go), main API (Python), and frontend (React). All services communicate through an NGINX API Gateway and are fully containerized. [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]

### Project Structure Details
Required monorepo structure: [Source: architecture/7-unified-project-structure.md]
```
network-monitoring-app/
├── .github/workflows/ci.yaml
├── apps/
│   ├── frontend/
│   ├── api-python/
│   └── collector-go/
├── packages/shared-types/
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md
```

### Technology Stack Specifications
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: React 18.2.0, TypeScript 5.0.4, Tailwind CSS 3.3.3, Zustand 4.4.1, Axios 1.5.0
- **Backend API**: Python 3.11, FastAPI 0.103.1
- **Backend Collector**: Go 1.21
- **API Gateway**: NGINX 1.25
- **Testing**: Jest & Testing Library 29.7.0 (frontend), Pytest 7.4.2 (backend)
- **Deployment**: Docker & Docker Compose (latest)

### Database Configuration
[Source: architecture/6-database-schema.md]
- **Time-Series**: InfluxDB Cloud Free Tier (bucket: network_metrics)
- **Relational**: PostgreSQL via Supabase Free Tier
- Database connections should be configurable through environment variables

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Use packages/shared-types for common TypeScript interfaces
- **Configuration**: Environment variables must be loaded into config modules, not accessed directly
- **Error Handling**: Implement centralized error handler in the API
- **Security**: All secrets must come from environment variables, never hardcoded

### Development Workflow
[Source: architecture/8-development-workflow-deployment.md]
- **Local Setup**: Fully containerized with Docker, started with `docker-compose up`
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- All services must be accessible locally for development

### Infrastructure Context
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]
- Target deployment: Oracle Cloud Free Tier
- Security & CDN: Cloudflare
- Architecture follows microservices pattern with API Gateway

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/10-testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Pyramid Approach**: Unit Tests (Jest/Pytest), Integration Tests, E2E Tests
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest & React Testing Library
- **Backend Testing**: Pytest for Python services
- Test files should be created alongside implementation

### API Gateway Configuration
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#architectural-and-design-patterns]
- NGINX serves as single entry point for all frontend requests
- Routes traffic to appropriate backend services
- Must be configured in docker-compose setup

### Service Communication
The Go Collector Service and Python API Service both connect to databases but operate independently. The React Frontend communicates only with the Python API through the API Gateway. [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]

## Testing
Based on the Testing Strategy [Source: architecture/10-testing-strategy.md]:

**Unit Tests Required:**
- Frontend: Jest & React Testing Library for component rendering
- Backend: Pytest for health check endpoint functionality
- Test the basic React header component loads correctly
- Test the FastAPI health endpoint returns expected response

**Integration Tests:**
- Verify React app can successfully call the health check API
- Test docker-compose brings up all services correctly

**Test File Locations:**
- Frontend tests: Adjacent to components with .test.tsx extension
- Backend tests: test_* files in appropriate directories using Pytest conventions
