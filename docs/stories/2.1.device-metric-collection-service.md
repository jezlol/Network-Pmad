# Story 2.1: Device Metric Collection Service

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** a backend service that periodically collects key health and performance metrics,
**so that** I can track their performance and populate my dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A backend service polls all devices at a configurable interval.
2. The service collects: Up/down status, CPU utilization (%), Memory utilization (%), Device temperature, Network traffic (bytes in/out), Disk space usage (%).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5: The authentication system is fully implemented with JWT tokens, role-based access control, and comprehensive security measures. The backend uses FastAPI with PostgreSQL for user management and the frontend has proper authentication flows. All API endpoints are now protected and require authentication.
