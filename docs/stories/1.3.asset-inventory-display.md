### Technical Implementation Notes
- **Routing**: Need to implement proper React Router for navigation between pages
- **API Integration**: Use existing axios instance with proper error handling
- **State Management**: Extend existing Zustand store or create device-specific store
- **Search Implementation**: Client-side filtering for better performance
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure table works on mobile devices with proper scrolling
- **TypeScript**: Use existing Device interface from shared-types package

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]

**Unit Tests Required:**
- Jest & React Testing Library tests for InventoryPage component
- Tests for DeviceTable component rendering and interactions
- Tests for search functionality and filtering
- Tests for API service functions

**Integration Tests:**
- Test complete flow from page load to data display
- Test error handling when API calls fail
- Test search functionality with real data

**Test File Locations:**
- Frontend tests: test files in apps/frontend/src/ using Jest & React Testing Library conventions
- Mock API responses for consistent testing

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/services/__tests__/api.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed axios mock to properly export default function and create method
  - **Why**: The original mock was missing the default export, causing test failures
  - **How**: Added proper default export structure to match axios module pattern

- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/pages/__tests__/InventoryPage.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed loading state test to not expect "Device Inventory" text during loading
  - **Why**: The test was incorrectly expecting UI elements that shouldn't be visible during loading
  - **How**: Removed incorrect assertion and focused on loading skeleton validation

- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/pages/__tests__/InventoryPage.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed "Unknown" text test to handle multiple instances using getAllByText
  - **Why**: The test was failing due to multiple "Unknown" elements in the table
  - **How**: Used getAllByText to properly validate multiple instances

- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/App.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed Dashboard test to use getByRole for more specific element selection
  - **Why**: Multiple elements contained "Dashboard" text causing test ambiguity
  - **How**: Used getByRole with heading role for more precise element selection

- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/store/__tests__/useDeviceStore.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed Zustand store state reset between tests using setState
  - **Why**: Store state was persisting between tests causing test interference
  - **How**: Used useDeviceStore.setState to properly reset state in beforeEach

- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/store/__tests__/useDeviceStore.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed network error test to use proper Error object with TypeScript typing
