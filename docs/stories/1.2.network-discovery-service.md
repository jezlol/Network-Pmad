## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: The basic FastAPI structure is established with health check endpoint, configuration module, and centralized error handling. The PostgreSQL database connection should be configured through environment variables. [Source: Previous Story 1.1 completion notes]

### Architecture Overview
This story implements the network discovery functionality as part of the Python FastAPI backend service. The discovered devices will be stored in PostgreSQL and later used for monitoring and visualization. [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]

### Technology Stack Specifications
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Backend API**: Python 3.11, FastAPI 0.103.1
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (via Supabase)
- **Testing**: Pytest 7.4.2

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
- **Device**: Represents a monitored device (id, ip_address, mac_address, hostname, etc.)

### Database Schema
[Source: architecture/6-database-schema.md]
- **PostgreSQL Schema**: CREATE TABLE devices (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, ip_address VARCHAR, ...);
- Device information should be stored in PostgreSQL for relational queries

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
- **POST /api/discover**: Triggers a network discovery scan
- **GET /api/devices**: Retrieves all discovered devices (for future stories)

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/7-unified-project-structure.md]
- Network discovery code should be implemented in apps/api-python/
- Shared Device types should be added to packages/shared-types/

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/11-coding-standards.md]
- **Type Sharing**: Device interfaces must be kept in packages/shared-types
- **Configuration**: Database connection and network settings must be loaded into config module
- **Error Handling**: Use centralized error handler established in Story 1.1
- **No Secrets in Code**: Database credentials must come from environment variables

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Network scanning should use standard Python libraries (socket, subprocess for ping)
- MAC address discovery may require ARP table access or network packet inspection
- Consider network scanning performance and implement appropriate timeouts
- Device discovery should handle both IPv4 networks
- Implement proper logging for network scanning operations

## Testing
Based on the Testing Strategy [Source: architecture/10-testing-strategy.md]:

**Unit Tests Required:**
- Pytest tests for network scanner module functionality
- Tests for device model and database operations
- Tests for /api/discover endpoint with mocked network scanning
- Test error handling for network timeouts and failures

**Integration Tests:**
- Test full discovery flow from API call to database storage
- Verify database connection and device persistence
- Test network scanning with controlled test environment

**Test File Locations:**
- Backend tests: test_* files in apps/api-python/tests/ using Pytest conventions
- Mock network responses for consistent testing

### Performance Considerations
- **Concurrent Scanning**: Network scanner uses semaphore to limit concurrent operations (20 max)
- **Database Operations**: Lazy initialization prevents unnecessary connection overhead
- **Memory Usage**: Proper cleanup of database sessions and async operations
- **Network Timeouts**: Configurable timeouts prevent hanging operations
- **Recommendations**: Consider implementing connection pooling and caching for frequently accessed device data

### Final Status
✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and demonstrates high code quality. The refactoring performed addresses modern best practices, eliminates deprecation warnings, and improves maintainability while maintaining full functionality and test coverage. The code is production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and architectural patterns.
