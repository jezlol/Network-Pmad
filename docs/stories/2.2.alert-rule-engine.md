# Story 2.2: Alert Rule Engine

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** network administrator,
**I want** to define custom alert rules that continuously evaluate against collected metrics,
**so that** I can be proactively notified when network conditions meet specific thresholds or criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can define custom alert rules with conditions (e.g., "CPU > 80%", "Memory < 10%")
2. The system continuously evaluates these rules against incoming metrics
3. When a rule condition is met, an "alert event" is created

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Backend API Implementation (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create alert_rules table schema in PostgreSQL
  - [ ] Implement POST /api/alerts/rules endpoint for creating rules
  - [ ] Implement GET /api/alerts/rules endpoint for retrieving rules
  - [ ] Implement PUT /api/alerts/rules/{id} endpoint for updating rules
  - [ ] Implement DELETE /api/alerts/rules/{id} endpoint for deleting rules
  - [ ] Create alert rule data models and validation
- [ ] Alert Rule Engine Implementation (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create background service for continuous rule evaluation
  - [ ] Implement metric querying from InfluxDB
  - [ ] Implement rule condition evaluation logic
  - [ ] Create alert event creation mechanism
  - [ ] Add error handling and logging for rule evaluation
- [ ] Frontend Implementation (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create Alert Rules management page
  - [ ] Implement rule creation form with condition builder
  - [ ] Implement rule listing and management UI
  - [ ] Add rule editing and deletion functionality
  - [ ] Integrate with backend API endpoints
- [ ] Testing Implementation (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Write unit tests for alert rule API endpoints
  - [ ] Write unit tests for rule evaluation engine
  - [ ] Write integration tests for rule evaluation against metrics
  - [ ] Write frontend tests for alert rule management

## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack
- **Backend API**: Python with FastAPI framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for alert rules storage, InfluxDB Cloud for metrics querying
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Testing**: Pytest for backend, Jest & React Testing Library for frontend

### Architecture Context
- **Project Structure**: Monorepo with apps/api-python/, apps/frontend/, apps/collector-go/
- **Shared Types**: Use packages/shared-types/ for type definitions shared between frontend and backend
- **Configuration**: Environment variables must be loaded into config module, not accessed directly
- **Error Handling**: Use centralized error handler in the API

### Data Models
From architecture docs (4-data-models.md):
- Alert Rule fields: `id`, `name`, `metric_name`, `condition`, `threshold`

### Database Schema
From architecture docs (6-database-schema.md):
- **PostgreSQL**: CREATE TABLE alert_rules (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR, ...);
- **InfluxDB**: Bucket: network_metrics, Measurements: device_metrics (Tags: device_id, metric_name; Fields: value)

### API Endpoints
From architecture docs (5-api-specification.md):
- GET /api/alerts/rules - Get all alert rules
- POST /api/alerts/rules - Create a new alert rule
- PUT /api/alerts/rules/{id} - Update an alert rule
- DELETE /api/alerts/rules/{id} - Delete an alert rule

### Previous Story Context
From story 2.1 (Device Metric Collection Service):
- InfluxDB integration is already established
- Metric collection from devices is operational
- Database connection patterns and configuration are established
- FastAPI project structure is in place

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Backend API: `apps/api-python/`
- Frontend: `apps/frontend/src/`
- Shared types: `packages/shared-types/`
- Database migrations: `apps/api-python/migrations/` (if applicable)

### Technical Implementation Requirements
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for frontend, Python type hints for backend
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization for alert rule management
- **Performance**: Efficient rule evaluation to handle multiple rules and high metric volume
- **Scalability**: Design rule engine to handle growing number of rules and devices

### Coding Standards
From architecture docs (11-coding-standards.md):
- Shared types in packages/shared-types
- Environment variables loaded into config module
- Centralized error handling in API
- No secrets in code - use environment variables

### Testing
From architecture docs (10-testing-strategy.md):
- **Unit Tests**: Pytest for backend, Jest & React Testing Library for frontend
- **Integration Tests**: Verify communication between services
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on rule evaluation logic, API endpoints, and UI interactions
- **Test Data**: Use mock metrics data for rule evaluation testing
